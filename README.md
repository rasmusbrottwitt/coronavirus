# Covid 19 and the world 

2020 has been a year that will forever be remembered for the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not the first pandemic in world histori to say the least, but it is the first time it has happened to our modern society. We have the opportunity to track the spread to a very low detail, and at the same time see and uncover it's impact on all aspects of society. 

In that way, the Corona Virus is more than just a disease - it is a shift in how our world works, and has the potential to  hit the economy really hard especially. The reasoning for this is more complex - we have to understand how the virus spreads physically and psyhologically, and then look at how it has impacted the economy. 

We will look at the spread of the virus itself and the fear and awareness following, to see how and why the countries have had to lock down. Following this, we will look into the American Economy and see how it has hit - and why it might be a lot different than you expect. 

## The spread of Corona Virus
The Corona Virus started as a new disease in China, and became more and more reknown to the world as stories and images spread. After reaching Italy in February, it stared spreading to the rest of the world and was declared a pandemic in mid March.

In the following maps, the dahsed line indicates lockdown times, and its color matches the countrystats.

It's growth has been rapid ever since then.

The reason for the massive growth is very clear when plotting out deaths world wide - the spread went from one country to globally, with the deathrates following.

        width="900" height="400"

The mortality rate appears to have been close to contant since the spread, which is clear in a logarithmic view of the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths.

        width="900" height="500"

However by diving deeper into the numbers we see another picture. Since the outbreak as a Pandemic, the mortality rate has actually increased from 2-3% to around 6%.

        src="Charts/webpage003.png"
        width="900" height="500"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

And looking at the mortality rate on a global view, it is clear that it varies from country to country,

        src="Charts/webpage005.html"
        width="900" height="400"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

There are many possible factors of the change in mortality rate. An unknown variable is testing strategy and number of tests, as well as the possibile effect of the tuberculosis vaccine (https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/australia-bcg-vaccine-trial-covid-19/). 

The largest factor in the combat of the disease for now has been the massive lockdowns almost every country has done. However, some countries have deffinetly hesitated, most likely because of the consequences on the economy. So, what effect did these lockdowns have - and did the timing matter? 

### Spread and lockdown in different countries
The spread in different countries, and especially also the number of deaths, appear to be very different. To gain an understanding of why this is the case, let's look into the rate that each country locked down in compared to the casualties.

        src="Charts/webpage006.html"
        width="900" height="450"
        frameBorder="0"

We see how the virus deaths exploded suddenly in US, and that the US clearly is on the red curve. In comparison is countries as canada currently staying at the green curve. The dashed vertical lines indicates the lockdown date for each country. We see a huge different between Denmark and Canada that makes national lockdown before any deaths has arise, and clearly are on the green curve, compared to US, UK, and Italy which all made national lochdown pretty late when above 300 deaths had happened and clearly are on the red curve. Especially the United States seem to have exploded in number of casualties. 

By comparing time from first outbreak to time of lock down, we see a clear picture

        src="Charts/webpage007.html"
        width="900" height="450"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>


Lockdowns seem to work. The countries that locked down the fastest had the greatest reduction and stabilization in cases. Furthermore, it is clear that growth rate has declined following a lock down regardless of timing and strategy. 

By looking a bit deeper into timing and effect of lockdown, it also becomes clear that the United States rate was by far the highest - until the lockdown.

        src="Charts/webpage008.html"
        width="900" height="450"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

This shows that if or when a new pandemic hits, quick actions from governments and responsible actions of individuals definetly seem to add up. 

### Predicting the (near) future
Now we see that lockdowns seem like a good idea - but can we possibly predict how big the impact is going to be? 

In general, predicting the future is hard - and in this case even more so. We are in an unpresedented situation, and all goverments are constantly shifting directions to limit the spread and effects. However, given the status as it is, we can get an idea of the direction we are heading in.
<iframe 
        src="Charts/webpage009.html"
        width="900" height="450"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

As it can be seen, some countries are still on the rise, and some have definetlu flattened the curve. China and Italy seem to have had their hit, and the curves are starting to flatten. The same can be said for Denmark, while UK, US and Canade are sill on a rise. 


To understand how the pandemic will continue to spread, we have applied prediction models to the data gathered, and predicting how the spread looks the next couple of days. 

### Potential reopening
Following the lockdown and the flattening of the curves, the natural next step would be to look at when to open up again. For every day the country is closed, money is slipping out of the economies, and governments have to write big checks to keep the wheels going for companies and individuals. 

To do this we can look at the true number of infected. The average time from infection to death is 17 days. This means that if the true mortality rate is 1% then if 1 person dies today was there 100 infected 17 days ago. This information can together with the avg. growth rate for COVID19 be used to give an estimate of the true number of infected in each country.

        width="900" height="400"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>
The charts clearly show why it would be very interstring to know the actual mortality rate. Relatively small changes is the mortality rate assumption from 3% to 1%  would mean that many many more million people would have had the infection. This is very important information to know when planning a reopening of a country like US.

### Summary
We have seen that the disease spread rapidly, with the death rate following and even increasing a bit, as the disease became pandemic. However, there is a large uncertanity regarding these numbers, and the difference between reported and true numbers might be big. 

We have also discovered how lock downs are a great idea to stop the disease, and faster actions give great results. Before looking into the costs of these lock downs, let us look into the social media awareness to see how the people have reacted to this (to our generations) new phenomenon. 

## Social Media Data from Twitter
We gathered 1308276 from a dataset of kaggle, with country codes, between March 12th and April 30th. It can be seen that the tweet amount peaked around mid-late march and then stabelized at a lower level in april.

        src="Charts/webpage013.html"
        width="900" height="550"
        frameBorder="0"

By looking at a couple of potential buzz words for the awareness - "Just a flu", "Apocalypse", "Stayhome", "Economics" and "Reopen" we can get an idea of how the awareness has intensified and behaved. 

We included bars to show then key events took place in the Unites States. Furthermore 

<iframe 
        src="Charts/webpage011.png"
        width="900" height="550"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

Many interesting trends can be seen in the above chart. First of all does it seem like the closing of schools and sport leagues as well a leak of a pretty pessimistic secret report kick starts the american puplic COVID19 attention on twitter. 

It can be seen that both the "just a flu"-tweets and the "Apocalypse"-tweets is peaking around this date. However since the peak has both the amount of "just a flu"-tweets and the "Apocalypse"-tweets been steadly decreasing. It certainly looks like people found out that this not is our doom as humans but neither just a basic flu. 

In general is the amount of tweets concerned about economics and preventing spread almost the same. In other words does the economics consequense of the virus get just as much attention as how to avoid the virus spread. When looking only at the "Economics"-tweets trend can it be seen that a big increase in social media attention happened the same day as US had been in lockdown for almost a month and the gonvernment made a statement with no reopening insight. This is also the date where the 'Reopen!'-tweets starts to increase. Â¨


However, we want to focus our attention on the reaction to the economy. We have added some extra buzzwords to look for regaring the publics perception of economy - "Unemplyment", "Economy" and "Financial Crisis". 

<iframe 
        src="Charts/webpage012.png"
        width="900" height="550"
        frameBorder="0"

The chart shows us a weekly trend in the 'Unemployed'-tweets. Futher investigation showed that these tweets peak the same day as the weekly official unemployment number report surfaces. This trend has been happening since few days after the lockdown officially started. Futhermore is a huge jump in tweets about economy happening the day where the government states that no reopening is insight. This clearly shows the people's high concerns with the economic situation that the lockdown causes which also often has been compared to the financial crisis in 2008. 

So - let us investigate how the American Economy is behaving - for the individual, state and companies. 

## US ECONOMY
The US economy is a weird size, containing many variables. We will investigate general movements the last 40 years, especially from the largest companies, how the banks are behaving, and lastly the unemployment rate to see how the individual is affected. 

The Dow Jones index contains the 30 largest companies - and looking at the companies isolated gives us an idea of how the crisis rattles the market heavily.

        width="900" height="550"

But aggregating them is a good relfection of how the economy has behaved over time.

        src="Charts/webpage015.png"
        width="900" height="500"
        frameBorder="0"

Some historic moments, especially seen from a financial perspective, are remarkably clear

- The rise and burst of the IT bubble
- The Financial Crisis 
- Covid 19

For reference, Sars has also been annotatated to show its lesser significance on the market. 

As it can be seen, the Dow Jones has grown since it was introduced in 1986, with some smaller and larger bumps on the way. 

If we some in to the recent years after the financial crisis, we can see how the Dow Jones has dropped rapidly now after several years of growth - but now has seen a rise again. 

<iframe 
        src="Charts/webpage016.png"
        width="900" height="500"
        frameBorder="0"

Compared to the last recent large drop in value, the Financial Crisis, we see some major differences
<iframe 
        src="Charts/webpage017.png"
        width="900" height="550"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

The changes in movements here are obvious: 

- In the financial crisis, concerns grew over time leading to a long decline followed by a sharp drop
- With the Corona Virus, the shock was abrupt - but somehow the shock seemed to have had a lesser imidate impact. 

The pattern is clear to narrow down to a single line: 

**The financial crisis was caused by a rotten economy, with fragile and fraud loan structures. The Corona Virus was a result of a shock. Therefore, the value of the market reflected this.**

But still - we here massive issues in the American Economy, so why are the stocks not lower? 

A main reason is the Federal Reserve who printed a lot of money in late March to combate the drop in stocks - which resulted in the best day in Dow Jones ever value-wise, and one of the four largest relative speaking! https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-data-shows-biggest-hit-to-business-activity-since-records-began

        src="Charts/webpage018.png"
        width="900" height="800"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

So - for now the largest companies in America are doing relatively well, because of aid from the government. 

If we keep our focus on the Corona Crisis compared to the Financial Crisis of 2008, but shift our to the banks. 

### Banks
We have now investigated briefly how the stock market in general was affected. Now let us look at the big six banks in America - namely the banks noted too big to fail! 

"Too big to fail" describes a financial institution whose collapse would cause unsavable damage to the American economy.
The government will try to  intervene in situations where failure poses a grave risk, and save the economy from total collapse. 

Banks that the U.S. Federal Reserve has said could threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system are long - but we have focused on the largest players. 

Plotting them out shows how big they were during the mid 2000's, and how hard the financial crisis hit them. 

<iframe 
        src="Charts/webpage019.png"
        width="900" height="500"
        frameBorder="0"

And by zooming in on 2019-now, we see that the hit was not as bad in the fear of Corona Virus. 

<iframe 
        src="Charts/webpage020.png"
        width="900" height="500"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

The reason why is a mix of a slight change in structure for these too big to fail companies, the federal reserve printing extra money and that the banks are simply not as overvalues now as they were back in 2008. 

## Unemployment
A major reason of concern for both the banks and government, but especially the individual is the unemployment rate. Part of the initial reason for the collapse in 2008 was that people were not able to pay their mortgages - and the largest reason for people not being able to pay their rent is being unemployed.  

An obvious question is why would people become unemployed now, when the companies are not suffering too hard during lock down? Part of the answer is simple: many of these companies are not suffering because they lay off their employees while they are closed during the lock down.

        src="Charts/webpage021.png"
        width="900" height="550"
        frameBorder="0"

Looking at the unemployment rate, it seems like the highest spikes are around the financial crisis and back in the 1980's. 

But zooming in on 2019-2020 shows that the most recent datapoint is just too close to the border to see

        src="Charts/webpage022.png"
        width="900" height="550"
        frameBorder="0"
></iframe>

The unemployment has more than trippled from March to April, going from 4.4 to 14.2 percent of the American population. The unemployment rate has simply never been higher. 

This is a major concern for the American economy. 

# Conclusion
By diving into the numbers and articles we have presented, there are some conclusions we can already make: 

- The virus has spread quickly and is still going on. The mortality rate is high - but maybe there are some dark numbers and unknown variables. 
- Earlier lockdown correlates with less casualties. 
- The attention of the disease escelated fast, and especially concerns about the economy as soon as the American government started taking action
- The American economy is at a glance doing well, and has even had it's best day ever, but this is mainly because of some of the tools the government are leveraging at the moment. 
- Underneath the wellbeing of companies, a huge unknown is bubbling: unemployment. History shows us this could result in catastrophic impacts on the nation. 

However, the numbers and our first conclusion also shows that this is an ongoing pandemic and far from over. We have to learn from what we have done so far, what has happened in the past and adjust accordingly to prevent large consequences on our health, economy and wellbeing.
