Sunes beskrivelse: 

Project Assignment B
The deliverables for the Final project are

A website with your visualizations an accompanying text. I recommend you structure it as a kind of narrative data story (cf. the Segel paper we read during Lecture 7 and 8). The website should tell the story about the data that you're interested in getting across. In the simplest, most minimalist case, the website can be a very nice Jupyter Notebook hosted on nbviewer.

It should contain visualizations to let the reader explore the data that you're interested in getting across. It is a plus if some of them are interactive.
Your analysis behind the scenes can be technical and as advanced as you like (in fact the goal is to show you can combine data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization), but the website itself should not be technical, but rather aim at using visualization and explanation to get your data driven insights across to a non-scientific reader.

The idea is that you can create much more complex, dynamic and interactive analysis (and visualizations) using the possibilities available when you're creating a website. So it is a way for you to present your work in a way that everyone can understand it (like something you could show your parents).

An explainer Jupyter Notebook. The explainer notebook should contain all the behind the scenes data-analysis stuff, details on the dataset, why you've selected these particular visualizations, explanations methodology, etc.

More about the website
The main point of the website is to present your idea/analyses to the world in a way that showcases your use of what you've learned in class. The website should be self-contained and tell the story without the need for the details in the explainer notebook (the purpose of the explainer notebook is to provide additional details for interested/scientific readers).

More on the explainer notebook
The notebook should contain your analysis and code. Please structure it into the following sections

Motivation.
- What is your dataset?
- Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?
- What was your goal for the end user's experience?
- Basic stats. Let's understand the dataset better
- Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing
- Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.

Data Analysis
- Describe your data analysis and explain what you've learned about the dataset.
- If relevant, talk about your machine-learning.
- Genre. Which genre of data story did you use?
- Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?
- Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?
- Visualizations.
- Explain the visualizations you've chosen.
- Why are they right for the story you want to tell?

Discussion. Think critically about your creation
- What went well?,
- What is still missing? What could be improved?, Why?

Contributions. Who did what?
- You should write (just briefly) which group member was the main responsible for which elements of the assignment. (I want you guys to understand every part of the assignment, but usually there is someone who took lead role on certain portions of the work. That's what you should explain).
- It is not OK simply to write "All group members contributed equally".

Make sure that you use references when they're needed and follow academic standards.
